# push_swap
push_swap project I am working on in Hive Helsinki


This projects aim is to sort all integers in stack (stack_a) by using only one extra stack (stack_b) and limited 
amount of moves:

sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
